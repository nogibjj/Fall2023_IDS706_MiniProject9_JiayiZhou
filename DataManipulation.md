1. **Loading the Dataset**: The notebook loads the dataset.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - It prints the head of the dataset.
   - It prints the tail of the dataset.
   - It displays the columns of the dataset.
   - It provides information about the shape (number of rows and columns) of the dataset.

3. **Summary Statistics**: Descriptive summary statistics of the dataset are generated.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Two bar plots are created to visualize the age distribution for alcohol use.
   - Two bar plots are created to visualize the age distribution for marijuana use.

5. **Data Filtering**: The observations related to individuals under the age of 18 are filtered.

6. **Data Sorting**: The dataset is sorted based on the percentage of alcohol use in the group.
